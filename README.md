# RomanNumeralProject
Coded for a job application. This code will walk you through converting Roman numerals to decimal numbers and vice versa. The code is contained in main.cpp, and main.exe is designed to run in the command line of a windows computer.

This took about 3 and a half hours to complete, the last half hour was spent adding documentation and making it look nicer.
